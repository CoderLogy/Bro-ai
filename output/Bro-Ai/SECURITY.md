# Security Policy
As the owner of a GitHub project, it is essential to establish a security policy to protect your repository and address any potential bugs or security issues that may arise. Here's a template you can use to create a security policy for your project:

## Reporting Security Issues
We take security seriously and appreciate the efforts of the community to improve the security of this project. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or have concerns regarding the project's security, please follow these steps:

#### Issue Reporting: 
If you have identified a bug or security vulnerability, please open a new issue in the project's issue tracker. Provide a clear and detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it if possible. Screenshots, code snippets, or any additional information that can help in understanding and resolving the issue would be valuable.

## Bug Bounty Program
At this time, we do not have a formal Bug Bounty Program in place. However, we value the contributions of the security community and may be willing to provide recognition and thanks to individuals who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities. If you would like to report a vulnerability and be considered for acknowledgment, please follow the steps mentioned in the "Reporting Security Issues" section.
